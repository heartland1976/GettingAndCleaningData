This project contains a single script called

    run_analysis.R
    
This script can take the data sets produced by an experiment collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone and transform this in a clean dataset, applying knowledge gained from the Getting and Cleaning Data Course. 

Here is an explanation how to run the script:

- This script is to be put in the root folder of the project. 
- The data-set is to be unzipped in a subfolder UCI HAR Dataset
- If needed adjust the first line of the R-file to accommodate for setting the correct working directory. 
- Source the file
- After the file is completed (which may take several moments), the clean data set is present in the same folder as the R-file and is named

    tidy.txt
    
- An additional markdown file is present explaining the variables, raw, and processed data and the transformations to get from raw to processed.

Have fun!
